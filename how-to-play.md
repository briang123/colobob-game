- **MOUSE** - Look around and control camera view
- **SPACE** - Jump (hold to charge for higher jumps)
- **G** - Toggle gravity on/off (only works after finding the gravity switch)
- **E** - Interact with objects (placeholder for future features)
- **ESC** - Toggle mouse lock (click to lock mouse to game)
- **CLICK** - Lock mouse to game for full 3D control
- **F** - Toggle fullscreen
- **J** - Toggle jump debugger window

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Mechanics

### 3D Movement & Physics

- **First-Person Movement**: WASD moves relative to where you're looking
- **Mouse Look**: Full 360-degree camera control with mouse
- **3D Gravity**: Realistic physics with gravity affecting all objects
- **Low Gravity Mode**: When gravity is disabled, you float more and jump higher
- **Platform Collision**: Land on 3D platforms to avoid falling
- **Wall Collision**: Cannot pass through prison walls

### Health System

- **Starting Health**: 100 HP
- **Health Packs**: Green glowing spheres restore 25 HP
- **Damage**: Touching blue aliens causes 10 HP damage
- **Game Over**: When health reaches 0 (currently resets health)

### Collectible Items

- **üü¢ Health Pack** (Green Sphere): Restores 25 health points
- **üü° Gravity Switch** (Yellow Sphere): Enables the G key to toggle gravity
- **üî¥ Weapon** (Red Sphere): Future combat item (currently placeholder)

### Enemies

- **Blue Alien Guards**: 3D capsule-shaped enemies that patrol back and forth
- **AI Behavior**: Simple patrol patterns between set boundaries
- **Gravity Effect**: When gravity is disabled, guards move slower and become disoriented
- **Damage**: Contact with guards causes health loss
- **Visual Effects**: Rotating enemies with shadow casting

### 3D Environment

- **Industrial Sci-Fi Aesthetic**: Metallic platforms with realistic 3D lighting
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Multiple light sources including ambient, directional, and point lights
- **Shadow System**: Real-time shadows cast by all objects
- **Glowing Elements**: Items have emissive materials that glow
- **Particle Effects**: 3D particle systems for visual feedback
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Cyan point lights create sci-fi atmosphere

## üñ•Ô∏è UI Elements

- **Health Display**: Shows current health out of 100
- **Gravity Status**: Shows if gravity is ON or OFF
- **Position Display**: Shows 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z)
- **FPS Counter**: Shows current frame rate
- **Crosshair**: Center-screen aiming reticle
- **Control Guide**: Bottom-left corner shows all available controls

## üéØ Strategy Tips

1. **Collect the Gravity Switch First**: This gives you the ability to confuse enemies
2. **Use Low Gravity Strategically**: Toggle gravity off to reach higher platforms or escape enemies
3. **Master 3D Movement**: Use mouse to look around and plan your escape route
4. **Avoid Direct Contact**: Blue aliens will damage you on touch
5. **Manage Health**: Collect green health spheres to stay alive
6. **Use Mouse Lock**: Click to lock mouse for better 3D control
7. **Plan Your Route**: Use the 3D prison layout to your advantage

## Jump Debugger Window

Press **J** to toggle the jump debugger window. This floating panel allows you to:

- **Base Jump Power**: Adjust the minimum jump strength (0.1 - 3.0)
- **Max Jump Power**: Adjust the maximum jump strength when fully charged (0.1 - 5.0)
- **Gravity**: Control how strong gravity is (0.05 - 0.8)
- **Charge Time**: Set how many frames it takes to reach maximum charge (5 - 30)
- **Movement Speed**: Adjust how fast you move (0.05 - 0.5)

### Using the Debugger

1. Press **J** to open the debugger window
2. Adjust sliders in real-time to test different jump behaviors
3. Click **Copy Settings** to copy the current settings to your clipboard
4. Paste the settings in chat to have them permanently applied to the game
5. Click **Reset to Default** to return to original settings
6. Click the **√ó** button or press **J** again to close the window

## Tips

- Use the jump debugger to find the perfect jump settings for your playstyle
- Experiment with different gravity and jump power combinations
- The debugger settings are applied immediately, so you can test changes in real-time
- Once you find settings you like, copy them and share with the developer to make them permanent
