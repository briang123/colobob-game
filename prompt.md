# Space Prison Escape 3D - Development Prompts & Instructions

## üìù Original Prompts

### Initial Game Concept (User's First Request)

```
I want to make a platformer game where you can move around a character with WASD keys on the keyboard. Can you help me work through a theme for this game?

I'm looking to create a game that is in outer space and in a prison with a main character that is human, but there are blue aliens who are the enemies. I want to defeat these enemies and escape from the prison. The game is dark and mysterious and there is low gravity since it's in outer space.
```

### Enhanced Theme Development (User's Second Request)

```
The space prison complex is futuristic, has high security, but has resources scattered across the cell and prison that will assist the human to escape; however, the prisoner needs to find them and learn how to use them first. The prisoner, who's wearing a tattered jumb suit, has been captured as hostage, but can morph into different shapes and change his appearance, as well. The enemies are blue aliens with storm trooper type uniforms and are security droids, but aren't that smart. they're their to make sure the prisoners stay in their cells. There are the elite guards who aid in fixing problems or emergencies related to a prisoner's escape. The gameplay mechanics includes a resource where the human prisoner might find a switch to turn off gravity to maybe help him in his escape because the security droids may become disoriented. I want all the game mechanics you listed. The visual style should be an industrial sci-fi aesthetic, glowing elements, and has bright lighting (not dark and moody), but in the cells it's dimmly lit.

Let's start building with WASD moment for the main character. The game should use javascript/html5 canvas so we can play in the browser.

### Cursor Rules Request (User's Third Request)

```
/Generate Cursor Rules  Can you create and maintain a "how to play" guide and update it with this information? Also, anytime I ask for changes, can update a prompt.md file with an optimized instruction to build the game. please make sure to include the original prompts, as well.
```

### 3D Conversion Request (User's Fourth Request)

```
are you able to make this a 3D game?
