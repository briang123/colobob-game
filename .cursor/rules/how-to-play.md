# Space Prison Escape - How to Play Guide

## 🎮 Game Overview

You are a human prisoner trapped in a futuristic space prison complex. You must escape by navigating through the industrial prison environment while avoiding blue alien guards and collecting resources to aid your escape.

## 🎯 Controls

- **WASD** - Move your character left, right, up (jump), down
- **SPACE** - Jump (works when on ground)
- **G** - Toggle gravity on/off (only works after finding the gravity switch)
- **E** - Interact with objects (placeholder for future features)

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics

### Movement & Physics

- **Normal Gravity**: Standard platformer physics with gravity pulling you down
- **Low Gravity Mode**: When gravity is disabled, you float more and jump higher
- **Platform Collision**: Land on platforms to avoid falling
- **Wall Collision**: Cannot pass through walls

### Health System

- **Starting Health**: 100 HP
- **Health Packs**: Green glowing items restore 25 HP
- **Damage**: Touching blue aliens causes 10 HP damage
- **Game Over**: When health reaches 0

### Collectible Items

- **🟢 Health Pack** (Green): Restores 25 health points
- **🟡 Gravity Switch** (Yellow): Enables the G key to toggle gravity
- **🔴 Weapon** (Red): Future combat item (currently placeholder)

### Enemies

- **Blue Alien Guards**: Patrol back and forth with glowing eyes
- **AI Behavior**: Simple patrol patterns between set boundaries
- **Gravity Effect**: When gravity is disabled, guards move slower and become disoriented
- **Damage**: Contact with guards causes health loss

### Environment

- **Industrial Sci-Fi Aesthetic**: Metallic platforms with grid background
- **Bright Lighting**: Well-lit prison environment (not dark/moody)
- **Glowing Elements**: Items, enemy eyes, and UI elements have glow effects
- **Particle Effects**: Visual feedback for actions like jumping and collecting items

## 🖥️ UI Elements

- **Health Display**: Shows current health out of 100
- **Gravity Status**: Shows if gravity is ON or OFF
- **Position Display**: Shows player coordinates
- **Control Guide**: Bottom-left corner shows all available controls

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

1. **Collect the Gravity Switch First**: This gives you the ability to confuse enemies
2. **Use Low Gravity Strategically**: Toggle gravity off to reach higher platforms or escape enemies
3. **Avoid Direct Contact**: Blue aliens will damage you on touch
4. **Manage Health**: Collect green health packs to stay alive
5. **Plan Your Route**: Use the prison layout to your advantage
