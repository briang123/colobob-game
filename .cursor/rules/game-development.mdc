# Space Prison Escape - Development Rules

## Documentation Maintenance
- **Always update** [how-to-play.md](mdc:how-to-play.md) when adding new game features or mechanics
- **Always update** [prompt.md](mdc:prompt.md) with optimized development instructions for new features
- **Maintain consistency** between game code and documentation

## Development Standards
- **Visual Design**: Follow industrial sci-fi aesthetic with bright lighting and glowing elements
- **Color Palette**: Use established colors (#00ffff for UI, #ff6b35 for player, #0066ff for enemies)
- **Performance**: Ensure 60fps gameplay with smooth physics
- **Code Quality**: Use ES6 classes, proper collision detection, and particle effects for feedback

## File Structure
- [index.html](mdc:index.html) - Main game HTML with canvas and UI
- [js/game.js](mdc:js/game.js) - Core game logic and mechanics
- [how-to-play.md](mdc:how-to-play.md) - Player guide and instructions
- [prompt.md](mdc:prompt.md) - Development history and optimized instructions

## Quality Checklist
When adding new features, ensure:
- [ ] Collision detection properly implemented
- [ ] Visual feedback (particles) added
- [ ] UI updated to reflect new states
- [ ] Performance optimized for 60fps
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Visual design maintains consistency
